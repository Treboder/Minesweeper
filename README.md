# Minesweeper
This project will teach you how to work with lists in Kotlin. You will be dealing with algorithms for generating the minefield and processing the player moves.
They say a minesweeper makes only two mistakes in their life: the first is their choice of occupation, and the second one is fatal. In this project, you will create your own, safe "Minesweeper" â€“ a game that will be a brain teaser for both you and your players.
